# Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Groq API and BM25 for Document Search and Answering

## Overview

This project implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that combines the power of BM25 for document
retrieval with Groq's Llama-3 model for language generation. The primary goal is to answer user queries based on a given
document corpus, leveraging both retrieval and generation techniques.

The RAG architecture works by first retrieving the most relevant documents from a corpus using BM25, a popular
term-based retrieval algorithm. The retrieved documents are then passed to the Groq API, which uses Llama-3 to generate
natural language responses. This approach allows for precise document-based answering while maintaining the flexibility
and fluency of language models.

## Features

- Uses BM25 for efficient document retrieval
- Integrates with the Groq API to generate high-quality answers using Llama-3
- Handles complex queries by combining retrieval and generation techniques
- Supports streaming responses for real-time query answering

## Setup

1. Prepare a document corpus for retrieval.
2. Use BM25 to rank documents based on relevance to the query.
3. Connect to Groq's API to pass the retrieved documents and generate an answer.
4. Evaluate the generated responses for accuracy and quality.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Groq API client
- NLTK (for tokenization and BM25)
- Rank-BM25 (for document retrieval)
- Any other necessary Python libraries such as transformers for pre-trained models

Install the required libraries through your preferred package manager.

## Usage

1. Initialize the document corpus.
2. Submit a query, and BM25 will retrieve the most relevant documents.
3. The retrieved documents are sent to the Groq API for Llama-3 to generate an answer.
4. Stream or display the result.

This approach enables efficient document searching combined with advanced natural language generation, making it
suitable for various tasks like question answering, document summarization, or knowledge retrieval.

## API Integration

This project uses the Groq API to handle language generation. Make sure to obtain your API key from Groq and integrate
it into your project to authenticate and access the Llama-3 model. The API will handle the heavy lifting of generating
answers based on the retrieved documents.

## Evaluation

The quality of generated responses can be evaluated manually or using automated metrics like ROUGE or BLEU. This helps
in assessing how well the model answers queries based on the provided corpus. You can also tweak the temperature and
top-p parameters to control the generation's creativity and relevance.

## Future Work

- Expanding the corpus for larger-scale retrieval
- Experimenting with different retrieval algorithms besides BM25
- Fine-tuning the Llama-3 model for specific domain-related queries
- Adding advanced evaluation metrics to measure performance
